# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) refers to the capability of machines to identify various activities performed by the users. The knowledge acquired from these systems/algorithms is integrated into many applications where the associated device uses it to identify actions or gestures and performs predefined tasks in response.

## Dataset
We are interested in classifying human activities based on accelerometer data. we will be using a publically available dataset called [UCI-HAR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567275). The dataset is available to download [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). Just for your reference a youtube video of the authors collecting participant's accelerometer data is also available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A). 

## Task 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [3 marks]

### Preprocessing
We will use the raw accelerometer data within the inertial_signals folder. The provided script, `CombineScript.py`, organizes and sorts accelerometer data, establishing separate classes for each category and compiling participant data into these classes. `MakeDataset.py` script is used to read through all the participant data and create a single dataset. The dataset is then split into train,test and validation set. We focus on the first 10 seconds of activity, translating to the initial 500 data samples due to a sampling rate of 50Hz.

* **Step-1>** Place the `CombineScript.py` and `MakeDataset.py` in the same folder that contains the UCI dataset. Ensure you have moved into the folder before running the scripts. If you are runing the scripts from a different folder, you will have to play around with the paths in the scripts to make it work.
* **Step-2>** Run `CombineScript.py` and provide the paths to test and train folders in UCI dataset. This will create a folder called `Combined` which will contain all the data from all the participants. This is how most of the datasets are organized. You may encounter similar dataset structures in the future.
* **Step-3>** Run `MakeDataset.py` and provide the path to `Combined` folder. This will create a Dataset which will contain the train, test and validation set. You can use this dataset to train your models.


### Questions

1. Plot the waveform for one sample data from each activity class. Are you able to see any difference/similarities between the activities? You can plot a subplot having 6 columns to show differences/similarities between the activities. Do you think the model will be able to classify the activities based on the data? **[0.5 marks]**
2. Do you think we need a machine learning model to differentiate between static activities (laying, sitting, standing) and dynamic activities(walking, walking_downstairs, walking_upstairs)? Look at the linear acceleration $(acc_x^2+acc_y^2+acc_z^2)$ for each activity and justify your answer. **[0.5 marks]**
3. Visualize the data using PCA. **[1 marks]**
    * Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on Total Acceleration $(acc_x^2+acc_y^2+acc_z^2)$ to compress the acceleration timeseries into two features and plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities. 
    *  Next, use [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ([a featurizer library](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel)) to create features (your choice which ones you feel are useful) and then perform PCA to obtain two features. Plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities. 
    *  Now use the features provided by the dataset and perform PCA to obtain two features. Plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities.
    *  Compare the results of PCA on Total Acceleration, TSFEL and the dataset features. Which method do you think is better for visualizing the data? 
4. Calculate the correlation matrix of the features obtained by TSFEL and provided in the dataset. Identify the features that are highly correlated with each other. Are there any redundant features? **[1 marks]**
